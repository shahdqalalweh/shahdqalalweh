# Peace be upon you, folks 👋

I'm Shahd Qalalweh, a senior Computer Systems Engineering student 👩‍💻

These days, I'm working hard to improve my skills, explore new things, and build better code (or at least break things in creative ways 🤷‍♀️).

I’m learning and building with:
- 💻 .NET (C#)
- 📱 Flutter
- 🐍 Python 

Feel free to check out my projects — and if you have any feedback or comments on my code, I’d really appreciate it!
