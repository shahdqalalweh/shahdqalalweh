# Peace be upon you, folks 👋

I'm **Shahd Qalalweh**, a senior Computer Systems Engineering student 👩‍💻  

Currently, I’m focusing on sharpening my technical skills, exploring new technologies, and writing cleaner (sometimes creative) code.  

I’m learning and building with:  
- 💻 .NET (C#)  
- 📱 Flutter  
- 🐍 Python  

📄 You can view my **CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ITwl8ulzavwW4GaoDBTcL_BaRdFNHm8e/view?usp=sharing)**  

Feel free to explore my projects — and I’d be glad to hear your thoughts or feedback! 🚀
